V 1.1 ChangeLog
---------------


----NEW FEATURES----

-> 	Animation types are now calculated in localSpace!
	(except for: FollowTarget, LookAtTarget and LookAlongCurve because that would make no sense)
	This way you the animation is rotated with the parent, which is the expected behaviour.
	The whole movement and rotation system is now much more flexible!

->	Created a new type of follow target animation, you can control the maximum velocity, acceleration and the snap range
	This type works better over long distances, since it has a limited velocity

->	New rotation type LookAlongCurve has been added!

->	You can now rotate the perlin noise bounds by rotating the parent object!
	(makes more sense than using the actual objects rotation, because its rotation is possibly animated as well)

->	The world space / local space option was a bit unintuitive when used in stacked animations
	Now you can use the option "Use Position as Offset" to maintain the default position during the animation

->	Removed the use Parent option, because it was unnecessary. Everything works as you would expect.


----BUG FIXES----

->	Default object positions are saved, even if the scripts recompile at runtime

->	Handles of Bezier Curve points are now calculated in the local space of the curve object
	This way you can rotate and scale whole curves as expected, without having to tweak the handles

-> 	Fixed a bug, where the child object changed its default position every time the simulation stops

->	Fixed the Unity Console Warning about MovementPlusWindow class

->	Everything moved into the MovementPlus namespace to avoid conflicts

->	Changed logo file name to avoid conflicts and fixed continuos logo loading

->	Some performance improvements


----FUTURE PLANS----

->	Implement constant velocity for bezier curves

-> 	More features for the MovementPlus Window (but I have no ideas yet)

->	Follow target animation type with a direction, velocity, acceleration and turning speed that moves physically accurate
	(steers like a spaceship)
